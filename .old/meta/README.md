**Overview**


Welcome to the GBC All in one advanced building platform. The purpose of this application is to provide an offline-first, one stop shop for builders across North America. Our goal is to provide the most up to date guides, technical data and installation techniques on various materials such as Huber Zip System, Siga and more. 

Each material page will include an interactive 3D model that you can view directly on your phone and accompanying documentation, both from the manufacturer and industry professionals covering best practices, installation methods, etc. the app will be fully functional offline, with the ability to download and save models, documents and even videos directly to your device for offline viewing - handy for on site locations without (reliable) internet access. The app will be fully open source, funded by manufacturers’ donations and supplemental purchasable content - more on this later.
